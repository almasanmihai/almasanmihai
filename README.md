## About Me
I am a civil engineer with 20 years of experience in designing high-raise buildings, earthquake-resistant. My main skill: solving uncommon problems, no matter the nature of the challenge and the time needed. Because I am eager to be challenged and learn, I decided to pursue my passion for programming and followed several intensive Python courses, which I enjoyed and successfully completed. With each Python project I complete, I am more passionate about this field and want to learn more.
